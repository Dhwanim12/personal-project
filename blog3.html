        <p>While the Personal Project is an individual project, it’s important for students to know that they have support from various sources. In this blog post, we’ll discuss how students are not alone when completing the Personal Project and who they can turn to for help.</p>
        <br><br>

            <h4>Personal Project Coordinator</h4>
            <p>
            The Personal Project Coordinator is a teacher who is responsible for overseeing the Personal Project. They are there to guide students through the process, answer questions, and provide feedback. I personally recommend you to show your final report to both your mentor and yor Personal Project Coordinator, as the coordinator is specialised in the project and can assist you in formatting and adding crucial elements to the report. Do not hesitat to reach out to their Personal Project Coordinator whenever you need assistance.
          </p>
<br><br>
            <h4>Personal Project Supervisor</h4>
            <p>
           The Supervisors are teachers that you have chosen to assist you throughout the process. It is important to chose a teacher who you are comfortable with, and know will provide you with constructive feedback. Usually, each supervisor only have 2-3 students that they are mentoring, so it is important to reach out to them in case of any challenges and struggles you face. They can provide guidance and  support throughout the project. 
          </p>
<br><br>
            <h4>Peers</h4>
            <p>
            Remember, the whole grade is completing the project, not just you. With the help of your peers, you can set you Personal Project study sessions (for online study session, use <a href="https://fiveable.me/dashboard">Fiveable</a>, have meetings with the PP Cordinator and share your resources. They can share ideas, provide feedback, and offer support. Collaboration with peers can help students stay motivated and on track. You can even create a padlet group and discuss different resources on there, something similar to <a href="https://padlet.com/kaysee2/exploring-atl-skills-2ddrgkbqcrvb7rw5">this</a>.
