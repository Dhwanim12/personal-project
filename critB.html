  <h1>Criterion B</h1>
  <h3>In Criterion B of the Personal Project, students have to evaluate what ATL skill they used to acheive their learning goal and their product goal (these two need to be different skills). Once the skill is identified, students can find the MYP ATL skill clusters and present evidence accordingly. Below are the 5 ATL skills, their clusters, and different types of evidence that you can collect for each of them.</h3>

<center>
<strong>Critical Thinking</strong>: Students need to identify patterns, and make relevant connections by comparing and contrasting and drawing conclusions. Students who have developed critical thinking skills are able to ask probing questions, consider alternative perspectives, and weigh evidence to make informed decisions.
<br><br>
<strong>Evidence</strong>: 
<center>
  <li>Identify gaps in knowledge and formulate key questions</li>
  <li>Plan to achieve goals, including identifying targets and outlining steps</li>
  <li>Make logical, reasonable judgments and create arguments to support them</li>
    </p>
<strong>Creative Thinking</strong>: Students need to generat new ideas or solutions to problems by brainstorming, lateral thinking, and visualizing possibilities. Students who have developed creative thinking skills are able to approach problems from multiple angles, take risks, and adapt their ideas to changing circumstances.

  <li>Utilize old ideas in new ways and combine parts in new ways</li>
  <li>Create original works and ideas and visualize alternative</li>
    </p>
<strong>Transfer</strong>: Students need to apply their learning and knowledge from one context to new situations or problems. Students should have skills such as recognizing patterns, generalizing concepts, and adapting strategies to new contexts. Students who have developed transfer skills are able to see connections between different areas of knowledge, apply what they have learned in new and unfamiliar contexts, and recognize the limitations of their own knowledge.
<br><br>
<strong>Evidence</strong>
  <li>Make connections between learning gained in different subject areas</li>
  <li>Applying skills and knwoledge in new contexts, subject areas and harder challenges</li>
  <li>Demonstrate personal responsibility for lifelong learning</li>
